Hi! My name is Claire and I'm currently a student at UC Davis majoring in Genetics and Genomics and planning to pursue a PhD in Biostatistics. My research interests are in statistical genetics and machine learning which I hope to apply in cancer and Alzheimer's research. I love to read with my favorite genres being Fantasy and Sci-fi!

[**Topological Molecular Biology Lab**](https://arsuaga-vazquez-lab.faculty.ucdavis.edu/){style="color:DarkCyan;"}

Apr 2021 - Present \| Davis, CA

The Arsuaga-Vasquez lab utilizes topological methods to study the 3D organization of DNA and proteins.

**Responsibilities**:

-   Analyzed viral datasets to extract and annotate proteins using sequence and structural similarity

-   Utilized profile HMMs in predicting SARS COV-2 mutation probabilities weighted by country

-   Cleaned and aligned genomic datasets using MAFFT and Clustal Omega

-   Grew and collected microbial cultures

-   Set up and performed gel electrophoresis

-   Prepared frozen samples using GP2 and imaged using Cryo-EM

-   Designed primers and performed qPCR to quantify DNA

-   Extracted DNA using miniprep or chloroform

## Research Assistant

[Korf Lab](http://korflab.ucdavis.edu/about.html){style="color:DarkCyan;"}

Dec 2022 - Present \| Davis, CA

The Korf lab studies the structure and function of various genes and genetic elements using computational methods.

**Responsibilities**:

-   Developed Python programs that use intron position to predict gene enhancement

-   Examined orthologous genes to identify introns with potential for enhancing genes

-   Created algorithms to identify motifs using discretized position weight matrices, regular expressions, and k-mers

-   Implemented a Stochastic Viterbi and forward-backwards algorithm in Python to generate random, probable isoforms

## Intern
