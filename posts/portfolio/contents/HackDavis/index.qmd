HackDavis Project 2023: A scavenger-hunt type game to introduce UC Davis to new students

[Trouble in Moo Town](https://saisuresh2.github.io/davis_adventure_game/)

This project was inspired by our desire to build a game that would encourage folks to go outside and appreciate our beautiful campus. We decided to integrate this idea with a tour-like game that would help incoming freshmen and transfers navigate our huge campus!

Made in collaboration with Sai Suresh, Jenna Noueihed, and Meghana Manepalli.
