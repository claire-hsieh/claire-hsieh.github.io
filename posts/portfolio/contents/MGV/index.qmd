Project at the Arsuaga-Vazquez lab to analyze the connector protein from a database of viruses sequenced from the human gut. 

The data was obtained from the paper, [Metagenomic compendium of 189,680 DNA viruses from the human gut microbiome](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-00928-6). Many of these viruses were previously unknown and the goal of this project is to create a general structure of the connector protein by obtaining and modeling many connector proteins whose sequences are available in the database. 

## Obtaining the Sequences
- Because connector proteins are not well conserved, sequence similarity will not be very high. Therefore, we will BLAST the connector protein domains against the database (rather than entire sequences) to find the connector protein. 

## Modeling
- We will be using AlphaFold and SWISS-MODEL to model the connector protein.
