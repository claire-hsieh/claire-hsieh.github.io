Cross-validation normally works by dividing the data into training and testing sets, where the training data is used to train a model and the testing set is used to evaluate model's performance (so prevent overfitting). Nested CV reduces bias even further by subdividing the data into inner and outer folds, where each fold has multiple CV's. The inner fold is used to tune model parameters and the outer fold is used to measure performance. \n  \n- Conclusion:\n  - Our best models were able to detect cancer at comparable rates to colonoscopy and CT-colonography (the gold standards of colonoscopy screenings, but are also highly invasive) and were superior to other colorectal detection tests that used fecal blood or dna to detect the presence of cancer. \n  \n\n![](Metabolomics_Project_Preserntation.pdf){ width=\"750px\" height=\"1000px\" }\n\n",
