Cross-validation normally works by dividing the data into training and testing sets, where the training data is used to train a model and the testing set is used to evaluate model’s performance (so prevent overfitting). Nested CV reduces bias even further by subdividing the data into inner and outer folds, where each fold has multiple CV’s. The inner fold is used to tune model parameters and the outer fold is used to measure performance.\n\nConclusion:\n\nOur best models were able to detect cancer at comparable rates to colonoscopy and CT-colonography (the gold standards of colonoscopy screenings, but are also highly invasive) and were superior to other colorectal detection tests that used fecal blood or dna to detect the presence of cancer."

    "text": "Project at the Korf Lab to find probable isoforms\nThe same gene can be used to create multiple different gene products by splicing exons together in various ways through alternative splcing. These different products or transcripts are called isoforms. And of the possible transcripts, most are rare but due to the random and messy nature of splicing, rare isoforms do occur at a measurable rate. Isoforms that do not conform to our expectations of random splicing are more likely to have biological function and to find these isoforms, we used the Stochastic Viterbi algorithm. To find likely isoforms, our algorithm randomly traversed a Viterbi trellis, and the Forward-Backward algorithm was used to find the probability.\nThe goal of this algorithm is to find multiple, likely paths through a hidden Markov model. The algorithm is based on the Viterbi algorithm, but instead of finding the most likely path, it finds the n most likely paths. Probabilities of being in a state are calculated using a forward-backward algorithm.\nThe repo for this project can be found here."
